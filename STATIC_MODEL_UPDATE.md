# Static Hummingbird Model - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Animations
- Commented out all animation playback code
- Model now shows in a static pose (default T-pose or rest pose from FBX)

### 2. Disabled Circular Motion
- Commented out all `useFrame` animation code
- Model stays centered at position `[0, 0, 0]`

### 3. Fixed Scale and Position
```tsx
<HummingbirdModel 
  scale={0.01}        // FBX models from Unity are typically 100x too large
  position={[0, 0, 0]} // Centered, same as debug sphere
/>
```

### 4. Added Size Debugging
The console will now show:
- Model dimensions (width, height, depth)
- Bounding box coordinates
- This helps determine the right scale

## What You Should See

1. **Pink debug sphere** at the center (for reference)
2. **Static hummingbird** at the same position, scaled down
3. **Console logs** showing:
   - "Hummingbird model loaded!"
   - Model dimensions
   - Available animations (even though disabled)

## Adjusting the Scale

If the model is still too big or too small, adjust the scale prop:

```tsx
// Too small? Increase scale
<HummingbirdModel scale={0.02} position={[0, 0, 0]} />

// Too big? Decrease scale  
<HummingbirdModel scale={0.005} position={[0, 0, 0]} />

// Just right? Perfect!
<HummingbirdModel scale={0.01} position={[0, 0, 0]} />
```

## Next Steps

Once you see the bird at the right size:

1. **Remove the debug sphere** by deleting `<DebugSphere />`
2. **Adjust position** if needed (move left/right, up/down)
3. **Adjust rotation** if you want it to face a different direction:
   ```tsx
   <HummingbirdModel 
     scale={0.01} 
     position={[0, 0, 0]}
     rotation={[0, Math.PI / 2, 0]} // Rotate 90Â° on Y axis
   />
   ```
4. **Re-enable animations** when ready by uncommenting the animation code
5. **Re-enable motion** by uncommenting the useFrame code

## Troubleshooting

### Model still not visible?
Check console logs for the dimensions. If extremely large (e.g., 100+ units), try scale={0.001}

### Model visible but too dark?
Increase light intensity or add more lights

### Want to see it from different angle?
Adjust camera position in Canvas:
```tsx
camera={{ position: [2, 1, 4], fov: fov }} // View from an angle
```
