# Hummingbird Loading Fix

## Problem
The hummingbird model was not visible even when the Sketch component was commented out.

## Root Cause
The FBXLoader import path was incorrect:
- ❌ **Old (broken)**: `three/examples/jsm/loaders/FBXLoader`
- ✅ **New (working)**: Using `useFBX` from `@react-three/drei`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Imports
```tsx
// Before
import { useLoader } from '@react-three/fiber'
// @ts-ignore
import { FBXLoader } from 'three/examples/jsm/loaders/FBXLoader'

// After
import { useAnimations, useFBX } from '@react-three/drei'
```

### 2. Simplified Model Loading
```tsx
// Before
const fbx = useLoader(FBXLoader, '/models/hummingbird.fbx')

// After
const fbx = useFBX('/models/hummingbird.fbx')
```

### 3. Added Suspense Boundary
```tsx
<Suspense fallback={null}>
  <HummingbirdModel scale={1.2} />
</Suspense>
```

### 4. Added Debug Helpers
- Pink debug sphere to verify canvas rendering
- Console logs to show model loading status
- Logs for animations, scale, and position

## How to Test

1. Run `pnpm dev`
2. Open your browser console
3. Look for:
   - A pink sphere at the center (confirms canvas is working)
   - Console logs: "Hummingbird model loaded!" with model details
   - The hummingbird model flying in circles

## Next Steps

Once you confirm the model is visible:
1. Remove the `<DebugSphere />` component
2. Remove or comment out the debug console.logs
3. Uncomment `<Sketch />` if you want the gradient background back
4. Adjust lighting, camera position, or model scale as needed
