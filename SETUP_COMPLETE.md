# ✅ Hummingbird Integration Complete

Your Low Poly Hummingbird asset is now integrated into your Hero section with full animation support!

## What's New

### 🎬 New Component: `GradientSceneWithHummingbird`
- Located in: `src/components/marketing/gradient-scene.tsx`
- Combines your gradient shader background with an animated 3D hummingbird
- Hummingbird flies in smooth circular patterns with natural bobbing motion

### 📍 Implementation
Your hero section at `src/app/(main)/page.tsx` now uses the hummingbird scene:
```tsx
<GradientSceneWithHummingbird className="rounded-4xl" />
```

## Animation Features

✨ **Circular Flight Pattern**
- Smooth parametric circular motion
- Automatic rotation to face direction
- Natural bobbing/hovering motion

🎯 **Lighting**
- Ambient lighting for overall visibility
- Directional light for shadows and depth
- Colored point lights matching gradient palette (warm yellow, pink)

🎨 **Materials & Textures**
- All 9 material variants automatically loaded
- Textures automatically applied
- FBX format preserves material information

## Quick Start

The integration is complete! Your app will now:
1. Load and render the hummingbird on the hero section
2. Animate it flying in circles with bobbing motion
3. Light it beautifully with matching gradient colors
4. Optionally play built-in FBX animations (wing flaps, etc.)

## Customization Options

See `HUMMINGBIRD_GUIDE.md` for:
- Changing flight patterns (radius, speed, direction)
- Adjusting lighting and colors
- Scaling the model
- Using built-in animations
- Responsive design adjustments
- Performance tuning

## Next Steps

1. **Test it**: Run `pnpm dev` and visit your hero section
2. **Customize**: Adjust animation speed, colors, lighting as desired
3. **Optimize**: Export to GLB format for production if needed
4. **Enhance**: Add mouse interactivity, multiple birds, etc.

## Troubleshooting

If the model doesn't show:
1. Check browser console for WebGL errors
2. Verify `public/models/hummingbird.fbx` exists (748 KB file)
3. Confirm materials folder copied successfully
4. Try opening DevTools Network tab to see if assets load

See `HUMMINGBIRD_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting.
